## Headline results

Higher is better for reader success and first place. Lower is better for mean rank, errors and broken code.

| Condition | Runs | Reader success | Mean rank | First place | Judged errors per doc | Invented-fact patterns per doc | Broken code |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `skill` (Wiki-Gnome skill) | 2 | – | – | – | – | 0 | 0 |

- **Reader success:** share of reader jobs that worked when a fresh session followed only the doc. Commands were run for real; quiz answers were marked against the answer key.
- **Mean rank:** average position in the blind ranking, where 1 is best and 1 is worst.
- **Judged errors:** wrong or invented details the judge found, checked against `fixtures/pantry-facts.md`.
- **Invented-fact patterns:** automatic matches for known false claims, such as `pip install pantry`.
- **Broken code:** runs where the writer changed code or the tests stopped passing.
